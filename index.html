                  It happened all of a sudden as I was wandering through the jungle, I came across a silhouette of a humanoid animal that was like no other, its shape was different and was standing firm on two feet. As I tried to move and take a closer look, it quickly noticed me and ran away. I went to check its previous location to see if I could find footprints but it left no trail behind except for its shedded skin. 27 long years have passed since I dared to explore the Saurian Gap, I have dedicated my life to research and find its whereabouts yet I still cannot locate nor trace the creature I encountered until I stumbled upon something interesting today.

                  For the past 3 days I have been hearing strange noises around my camp, maybe this will be the opportunity I have been waiting for because as I am writing this I have found something that might finally lead me to discover the creature I have encountered. I came across a strange egg during a stormy night and by the looks of it the mother has left it unattended to grab food and take shelter until the storm calms down. I have carefully examined the shell and I can say that it is as hard as a diamond yet there are already cracks around it, perhaps that is about to hatch. As my plan to know more about the creature I can choose to wait for this to break but I may never know how long it will take or if I try to speed it up the hatchling inside might die in the process so what I intend to do is….                </p>

                  It’s been awhile since my last writing, for I was busy due to an incident last time. While I was planning to incubate the egg my tent was thrown off and a creature appeared before me. It was dark so I was not able to get a clear view but to my surprise there were 3 of them. Each differed from the other and I could tell it from their forms, as they were creeping forward to me I am certain that they wanted the egg back. As a sign that I do not intend any harm I carefully placed it on the ground and moved backwards, a few seconds later as the fierce lighting struck down from the skies and the thunder growled it only took one blink and the egg was gone along with the 3 creatures I saw that night. After my discovery that there were other species, I started to sketch each of them in my memory and decided to keep exploring the jungle to look for more clues.                </p>

                  As I journeyed through the jungle I thought everything was over but it was then until I figured out maybe I am exploring it the wrong way. So with no hesitation I checked the maps and figured that I haven’t fully explored it because of a big boulder that blocked a pathway due to the shifting of tectonic plates centuries ago that caused a landslide. I immediately realized that if I cannot go over the path why not under it because if the Saurians couldn’t get past it as well there maybe another way. So I passed by the waterfall where I realized there is a cave behind it and an underground river that brings me to the otherside. I spent days on the other side and hunted for food and camped for shelter, then I saw a light flashing down from the sky, it was a blue light that I have never seen before and I heard a loud growl so I was certain it was the Saurians.                </p>

                  Days came and nights passed when I uncovered a secret path within the jungle and after a few hours of walking I finally saw my greatest discovery. A stone figure that looks like a gate, within the area I can sense a strong aura surrounding it, as I moved closer to it a small creature appeared before me it was hatchling, a baby saurian within my reach. I was astounded and began to approach it with care to my surprise it came to me like I was its parent I fed it some meat I had left in my pack as we intended with each other I didn’t notice the time and as an eclipse occurred the stone began glowing and a portal emerged as I looked on the other side it looked like a completely different world. It was drawing me and my curiosity cannot resist its temptation, so as I am writing this right now I will be entering a new journey to uncover more secrets with this new world and species.
